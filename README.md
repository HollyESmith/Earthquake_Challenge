# Earthquake_Challenge

## Overview & Purpose

The purpose of this project was to build visualizations with interactive features of earthquakes from around the world. I retrieved the latest 7 days of earthquake GeoJSON data from the US Geologic Survey website using JavaScript and D3 and Leaflet libraries, and then plotted the data on a mapbox map through an API request.

## Results

The magnitude and location of each earthquake is shown in a popup marker. The size and color of the marker reflects the earthquakeâ€™s magnitude. Fault lines were added to the map to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates.

The final composite map looks like this:

## Summary

This visualization shows that major earthquakes in the last seven days have occurred on or near a tectonic plate; smaller earthquakes may occur farther away. It would be interesting to research the cause of the smaller earthquakes!
